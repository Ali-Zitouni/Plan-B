    <h1>PLAN B</h1>
      <h2>Bitcoin’s Big Day</h2>

    <p> <strong>Tesla’s $1.5 billion investment in the cryptocurrency moved markets.</strong>
      
    </p>
    <p2>
      Cryptocurrency prices are soaring after Tesla said yesterday that it had purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin with company funds. 
      It also said it would accept payments in the cryptocurrency in the future. Bitcoin’s price, which had already been climbing, promptly set records.

The latest surge stands out for its magnitude. The recent rise has pushed the value of all cryptocurrencies to more than $1 trillion, with the bullishness extending beyond Bitcoin. There appears to be underlying momentum to the market, with more consumer apps allowing users to trade crypto tokens, fund managers moving money into these assets and, now, sizable industrial companies shifting some of their cash to cryptocurrency.

      <p>
        
      The news is an “exclamation point” for institutional acceptance of Bitcoin, Matthew Graham, the C.E.O. of the Beijing-based blockchain investment firm Sino Global Capital, told DealBook. “It’s clear that Bitcoin is ready for Main Street.” Tom Robinson, the chief scientist and co-founder of the blockchain firm Elliptic, called Tesla’s purchase “hugely significant.” Other experts had similarly positive things to say.
  <br>
          <br>
What about buying a Tesla car with crypto? Mariano Conti, a blockchain entrepreneur, has used crypto for collateral on a car loan. He said it would be “great” if Tesla accepted crypto payments, but added: “Most people I know use crypto as a way to hedge against fiat currencies, which we view as inferior, so I expect most people would rather hold their Bitcoin.”
  <br>
          <br>
        What’s in it for Tesla? Mr. Musk is known for bucking convention, so Tesla’s purchase is not as surprising as it would be at, say, Ford or G.M. Tesla had more than $19 billion in cash at the end of 2020, a big enough cushion to make the crypto purchase a relatively small share of its resources. But much of that cash was raised in recent stock sales, and the company only recently reported its second year of positive free cash flow. Although rising crypto markets make the company’s decision look wise in comparison to holding cash or low-yielding bonds, accounting headaches loom. (In short, Tesla will have to record declines in the value of its Bitcoin against its earnings, but can’t book gains.) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/business/dealbook/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-tesla.html?searchResultPosition=1">

    <h3>As Bitcoin’s Price Surges, Affluent Investors Start to Take a Look</h3>

    <p> <em>They want transparency and they want to be able to plan around it,” Joel Revill, chief executive of Two Ocean Trust, said of wealthy adopters of cryptocurrencies.</em>
       <p> <strong>Cryptocurrencies, originally a way to conduct business outside the financial system, are increasingly seen as an asset akin to private equity or venture capital.</strong>
      
    </p>
    <p2>
      Cryptocurrencies have soared in value. In a decade, they’ve gone from a fringe obsession that allowed coin holders to conduct business outside the financial system to an alternative investment managed as if it were any other investment. It hasn’t hurt that the price of a single Bitcoin has gone from zero to over $30,000 in that time.
<br>
      <br>
But if affluent investors are increasingly seeing cryptocurrencies the way they see other high-risk assets, like private equity shares and venture capital, that raises a new question for the people who manage their assets: How can a completely modern but volatile asset fit into legal structures that date back a century or more?
<br>
      <br>
Estate lawyers, trust officers and financial planners are just beginning to consider the ramifications of including Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, like Ether and Ripple, in portfolios as well as trusts, which have more exacting rules and stringent penalties for mistakes.
<br>
      <br>
The currencies still have a ways to go before they become mainstream investments. But giving some investors comfort are the custody and other back-office financial services that lower the risk of the currencies being lost or stolen.
    <br>  
      <br>
      “As Bitcoin gains more mainstream adoption, participants are now more sophisticated investors,” said Joel Revill, chief executive of Two Ocean Trust, a wealth management firm that offers investment, trust and estate planning services for traditional and digital assets. “They want to treat it like any other asset. They want transparency, and they want to be able to plan around it.”
      <br>
      <br>
      In some ways, that runs contrary to the original intent of cryptocurrencies, which existed outside a traditional financial system that provides investment advice and trust services. With their keys, cryptocurrencies are, in some ways, more like old-time bearer bonds. Those bonds were issued by a company or government, but weren’t registered like regular bonds. Instead, whoever held the certificate could redeem the bond for its full value. This put an early premium on not losing that sheet of paper.
<br>
      <br>
Today, the people who own some 20 percent of the 18.5 million Bitcoin in existence have apparently lost their keys, or passwords, to some $140 billion in those coins.
<br>
      <br>
Both large financial service companies and boutique advisory firms are aiming to reduce the management risk while capitalizing on wider interest in investing in cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technology.
<br>
      <br>
John Willian, a retired Goldman Sachs partner, bought Bitcoin last summer after following it for several years. He said the tipping point was when he felt the marketplace for Bitcoin had grown beyond the earliest adopters and the currency was beginning to be seen as a store of value.

    <h3>What’s Next for Crypto Regulation</h3>

      The DealBook newsletter delves into a single topic or theme every weekend, and today it takes you on a quick tour of the regulatory scene for cryptocurrency, a fast-changing field that may represent the future of the financial industry.
<br>
      <br>
Stock market mania has made the headlines in recent days, but recall that a run-up in crypto prices to new highs a few weeks ago raised all of the questions about investor protections and regulations now vexing policymakers coming to grips with GameStop.
<br>
      <br>
In fact, crypto prices are starting to go haywire again. Yesterday, Robinhood imposed restrictions on crypto trading, as it did for the stocks at the center of the market mayhem.
<br>
      <br>
The crypto world has been ahead of the curve when it comes to platform outages, outsize volatility and trading based on memes. Tension between the establishment and the masses is at the core of cryptocurrency, which was born from a desire for decentralization. The latest resurgence comes with regulations in flux as a new U.S. administration takes over.
